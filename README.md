## LFU (Least Frequency Used)
The page that is the least number of times of being called in a certain period of time will have the least chance of being called in the future.  
1. If a page is replaced by another page and enter the frame again, the frequency of page needs to recalculate.  
2. If the frequency of pages are same, then it decides which page is replaced by using FIFO.
